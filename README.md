Jackal User Manual
==================

This repository contains the LaTeX source code for building the end user product
documentation for [Jackal](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/jackal/). If you are
an end user, please download the official and released version of the manual from
the [Clearpath Robotics Resources Page](http://www.clearpathrobotics.com/jackal-user-manual/).


Build
-----


To build Jackal's user manual:

    git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/jackal/jackal-user-manual.git
    cd jackal-user-manual
    xelatex jackal.tex

The output is written to `jackal.pdf`. The `xelatex` command must be invoked twice
to generate the complete manual including table of contents and correct watermarks.

    sudo apt-get install texlive-xetex

Install some additional texlive packages:

    sudo tlmgr install everypage background titlesec microtype upquote \
